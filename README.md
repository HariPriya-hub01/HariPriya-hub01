# 👋 Hey there! I'm Hari Priya

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 👩‍💻✨  
I’m a **Biomedical Engineer turned Full Stack Web Developer** on a mission to blend tech and healthcare in creative, meaningful ways.

I started my journey designing surgical implants 🦴, geeking out over bones and joints and learning how tiny details can make a huge difference. Today, I channel that same curiosity and precision into coding full-stack web apps, building smooth user interfaces and experimenting with animations.

I enjoy taking ideas from concept to reality, whether it’s a simple project for learning or a fully functional web app. For me, coding isn’t just about getting things to work, it’s about creating experiences that are fun, useful and sometimes a little unexpected. I believe the best projects happen when curiosity meets persistence.

Thanks for stopping by! Stick around for code, experiments and a little bit of curiosity-fueled chaos! 😄

## 🧠 From Bones to Backend

I spent over 2.5 years in the medical device world — researching, prototyping and designing implants for orthopedic trauma surgeries. That taught me attention to detail, problem-solving under pressure and user-first design thinking.

Now I bring that same mindset to the world of web development. Whether it’s a UI layout or a Node.js API, I believe in building things that are clean, robust and actually useful.
