# 👋 Hey there! I'm Hari Priya

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 👩‍💻✨  
I’m a **Biomedical Engineer turned Full Stack Web Developer** on a mission to blend tech and healthcare in creative, meaningful ways.

Once upon a time, I was designing surgical implants and geeking out over bones and joints. Today? I’m coding full-stack web apps, building animated frontends, and occasionally dreaming of a JavaScript-powered stethoscope 😄

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Up To

- 🔧 Building real-world full stack projects (MERN stack)
- 🧠 Solving DSA problems in Python (and switching to Java soon!)
- ✨ Learning GSAP for buttery-smooth frontend animations
- 📱 Exploring mobile & backend development (Spring Boot or Flutter, here I come!)
- 🔬 Thinking of ways to bridge my biomedical past with my tech future

## 💻 Tech Stack I Use (and Love)

**Languages:**  
`JavaScript` • `Python` • `HTML` • `CSS`

**Frontend:**  
`React.js` • `GSAP` • `Tailwind CSS` • `Redux` • `Vite`

## 🧠 From Bones to Backend

I spent over 2 years in the medical device world — researching, prototyping, and designing implants for orthopedic trauma surgeries. That taught me attention to detail, problem-solving under pressure, and user-first design thinking.

Now I bring that same mindset to the world of web development. Whether it’s a UI layout or a Node.js API, I believe in building things that are clean, robust, and actually useful.

## 🔗 Let’s Connect!

I’m always open to collaboration, brainstorming, or just geeking out over tech (or biology). Reach out — I don’t bite, I debug 🐛💻
